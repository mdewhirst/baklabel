Livesite and Testsite

When you want to look at the test site, execute testsite.exe. Similarly,
when you wish to look at the live site, execute livesite.exe.

After installation look in the "Switch" folder on your desktop or wherever
you installed it for a file called line.example.

* rename or copy line.example to lines.<yourdomain>

* edit the lines file to reflect the IP address and domain name for testing

Note: If you don't have a file called lines.<something> nothing will happen.

Note: Because of browser cache issues it would be best to compare the test
site with browsers on one computer and the old live site with browsers running
on an adjacent computer.

After the test site goes live, execute livesite.exe again for the last
time. You should not then be seeing the old live site but if you are then
please report that as a DNS bug.

Don't hesitate to ask for help
