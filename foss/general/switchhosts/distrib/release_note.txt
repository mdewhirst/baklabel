livesite and testsite

livesite switches the test website back to the live site.

livesite checks the hosts file for the existence of entries for the test
website. If they exist the file gets re-written without them.

testsite switches the live website back to the test site.

testsite checks the hosts file for the existence of entries for the test
website. If they exist nothing happens. If not, test site entries are added.

Additionally (Windows only) testsite will execute (if it exists) a batch file
called 'proxy_remove.bat'. This exists in the same directory under a different
name 'proxy_remove_example.bat' as a precaution against unexpected execution.
See also two registry patch files in the same directory, similarly mis-named.
To make these work as expected edit both the content and names as desired.

When the test website goes live, it becomes the live site and livesite
should be run again finally so that the hosts file is no longer used to
find the website. By itself this proves that the DNS has been updated.

The source versions of livesite and testsite trigger an anti-virus warning
because they edit a system file. Just dismiss the warnings - provided they
occur exactly when you run one of these programs.
