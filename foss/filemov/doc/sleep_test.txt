Same file set of 444 files totalling 8,109,969 copy-overwrite from one network location to
another network location - so there is a fair bit of network processing happening and likely
not too much on the workstation. No profiling has been done.

The None figures come from before the code was changed. There is no discernable difference
between running sleep() and sleep(0) and not having sleep in the code. Likewise there is no
discernable difference if a test is introduced if YIELD > 0 when YIELD is zero.
